      <description>Earlier this year I wrote at the end of this post:&#xA;PS: In the meantime I switched complete to Markdown and Jekyll, a static site generator - but this is another story for another post &amp;hellip;&#xA;As always - it took a bit longer then expected. In the meantime I was fiddling around with Jekyll and modifying the default theme Minima to my needs.

I asked my collegue Markus, who had this error also some time ago (I could not remember the solution, although he told me about this issue).</description>
