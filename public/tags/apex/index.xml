NPM scripts for orchestration A complete example Another way Introduction Everyone who develops plug-ins for APEX knows the problem: Once a plug-in is finished, future maintenance is usually just a matter of uploading updated JavaScript files to the plug-in and finally downloading the plug-in to make it available to others.</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to spool/download BLOBS with SQL*Plus? Some months ago I tried to find a way to download a collection of CLOBs or even better a zipped version of the collection as BLOB. I learned that BLOBs are not a valid datatype in SQL*Plus when it comes to the spool command. I found a way by putting the CLOBs into a global temporary table, creating an intermediate SQL script with tons of select and spool commands, and finally spooling the CLOBs one by one by calling the intermediate SQL script.</description>

      <title>Quick start - version control for existing Oracle projects</title>

      <description>Many Oracle projects still do not use version control. The reasons for this are manifold. Mostly it is assumed that the database is a safe place for the source code. With a working backup this is also correct, but in any case one loses the complete history of changes. Often in running projects there is not enough time to deal with the introduction of source code versioning, because at first sight there is no direct benefit to be seen.</description>

      <description>PLEX is a PL/SQL package with export utilities - see this post what it can do for you. In the past it was dependent on APEX for two reasons: The APEX_EXPORT package to allow exporting an APEX app and the APEX_ZIP package for compressing the resulting file collection to a zip file.&#xA;After the first public release of PLEX, I got a comment like &amp;ldquo;Nice tool, but I don&amp;rsquo;t use APEX&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>First of all: Thanks to the community!&#xA;From time to time someone has new ideas or questions about the D3 network chart. Some time ago I thought my D3 implementation is more or less feature complete. But in the last weeks I worked again on the code to bring in new feature wishes from the community.&#xA;The most visible one in the new version 3.1 is the ability to add labels to links - see the links between Allen, Blake and Ward in the screenshot above.</description>

      <description>Since APEX version 5 was published with the Universal Theme, I was thinking that I needed something for better responsiveness of the graph. Although it was possible to configure the graph to use the DOM parent width, the responsiveness was not so good because of situations where the window size does not change (we use the window resize event to trigger the change of the width) but the available space for the graph changes.</description>

      <description>PLEX is a standalone PL/SQL package with export utilities. It was created to be able to quickstart version control for existing (APEX) apps. It currently has two main functions called BackApp and Queries_to_CSV. Queries_to_CSV is used by BackApp as a helper function, but its functionality is also useful as a standalone. This post is all about BackApp, which has the following features:&#xA;Export the app definition of an APEX app (splitted files and optional single SQL file) Export all ORDS modules from the current schema Export all object DDL from the current schema Export table data into CSV files Provide basic script templates for export/import of whole app for DEV, TEST and PROD Everything in a (hopefully) nice directory structure ready to use with version control Return value is a file collection of type plex.</description>

      <description>Since years it has been possible to export an APEX app definition with the help of APEXExport, a Java utility delivered within the APEX install zip file. There is also the possibility to split the file into its components like pages, plugins and so on. There are some blog postings available how to do this - simply ask Google. Also the Java based SQLcl has the capability to do the export of an APEX app directly.</description>

      <description>Maxime Tremblay has already described here how to customize the datepicker.&#xA;He had to deal with missing classes after changing options. I found this week a different way to customize the datepicker without loosing classes added by APEX: Simply by setting datepicker defaults on page load before any datepicker is initialized.&#xA;In my case I wanted to enable the button panel which shows two buttons - one to go to the current month which is called Today and a second one to close the datepicker which is called Done I only wanted the today button, so I had to provide beside the JavaScript or dynamic action some CSS to hide the second one:</description>

      <description>Today I stumbled over this strange behaviour of an APEX page: The page was always submitted when I pressed the enter key in a search field to force an AJAX refresh on a report.&#xA;The item property to submit the page on pressing enter was switched off. I asked my collegue Markus, who had this error also some time ago (I could not remember the solution, although he told me about this issue).</description>

      <description>Some weeks ago I was asked, if I can create a plugin for the Gantt chart library from dhtmlx.com. I had a look at the library and I thought that it should be possible.&#xA;Because all my plugin developments are free time projects it took a while. Now the first public version is available. It is based on the GPLv2 version of the library, which has a reduced set of functionality.</description>

      <description>Some years ago I implemented a task board in APEX. For commenting I used the stackexchange markdown implementation (old Google code repo), which is a pure JavaScript converter and editor and based on showdown.js.&#xA;Some months ago I had to implement an application, which should be able to have multiple editors on one page and the editors should be able to support a read only mode. Furthermore there were hard limits for the amount of text for each editor.</description>

      <description>Do you find dev.apex.mycompany.tld a nice, rememberable address? Unfortunately this will not work - at least when you use Internet Explorer (which is the standard browser in most companies) and you use the same cookie name in some or all applications to share the session across multiple applications.&#xA;What is the problem on a subdomain? Internet Explorer including version 11 has a really bad cookie implementation. If you login to your productive APEX instance under apex.</description>

      <description>My first Oracle APEX plugin and open source project :-)&#xA;Everything started some months ago when I stumbled over this fascinating force-directed graph. I immediately had the idea to use this technology to visualize data models in APEX. My experience is, that direct after I documented a data model, this documentation is out of date. I wanted to have a live visualization of the data models. After the first implementation it turned out, that the resulting graph is also useful for other purposes and I decided to build up an APEX plugin for easier integration.</description>

      <description>Do you like scanning a report for certain information and then moving the mouse to the first column to click the small link for details or a edit form? Would it be nice to double click anywhere on the row to open the first link?&#xA;With a little help of a dynamic action on page zero you have the solution for all your interactive and standard reports in your application. The only additional to do is, to find out the right selectors for your reports.</description>
