      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Link label example&#34; src=&#34;https://ogobrecht.com/posts/2019-06-09-new-version-of-d3-force-network-chart-available/link-label.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all: Thanks to the community!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From time to time someone has new ideas or questions about the D3 network chart. Some time ago I thought my D3 implementation is more or less feature complete. But in the last weeks I worked again on the code to bring in new feature wishes from the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most visible one in the new version 3.1 is the ability to add labels to links - see the links between Allen, Blake and Ward in the screenshot above. The labels are positioned in a way that they are always readable - this is the reason why they appear sometimes above and sometimes below a link line (they are rotated, if needed). The nice thing is that you can also read both labels when you have links in both directions between two nodes. The other benefit of having labels on links is that they extend the area for the link click and hover events. This improves the usabiltiy in cases where the links should show a tooltip when they are hovered or some action should be executed when they are clicked. This is normally not so easy because the links are so narrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--the graph container--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since APEX version 5 was published with the Universal Theme, I was thinking that I needed something for better responsiveness of the graph. Although it was possible to configure the graph to use the DOM parent width, the responsiveness was not so good because of situations where the window size does not change (we use the window resize event to trigger the change of the width) but the available space for the graph changes. How can the graph react to this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My first Oracle APEX plugin and open source project :-)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--the graph container--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything started some months ago when I stumbled over this fascinating &lt;a href=&#34;https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045&#34;&gt;force-directed graph&lt;/a&gt;. I immediately had the idea to use this technology to visualize data models in APEX. My experience is, that direct after I documented a data model, this documentation is out of date. I wanted to have a live visualization of the data models. After the first implementation it turned out, that the resulting graph is also useful for other purposes and I decided to build up an APEX plugin for easier integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
