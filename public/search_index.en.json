There is also the possibility to split the file into its components like pages, plugins and so on. There are some blog postings available how to do this - simply ask Google. Also the Java based SQLcl has the capability to do the export of an APEX app directly.\nSo why bother with a different way to export and split an APEX application?\nSince APEX 5.1.4 there is a new PL/SQL package APEX_EXPORT, which can be used to get a file collection of the application - one big file or the splitted ones. Unfortunately in the API docs there is (as of this writing) only one example available how to export the single file within SQL*Plus - no example to handle the splitted files.\nBut again, why discuss this if there are already options to do it?\nBecause of the possibility to modifiy the APEX_EXPORT file collection before fetching it into the file system. Imagine you have a different repository structure and the delivered file structure of the splitted files does not match your needs or you want to have all install files in one scripts directory of your repo and therefore need a relocation of the app install script. Another use case is to enrich the file collection with additional data or objects. This was possible in the past also with some postprocessing outside the database, but now we are able to do this within our DB session and PL/SQL. I have already started an open source project to leaverage these possibilities - more about this in my next post…\nSo how to do it?\nFirst, I have to describe what the sctructure of each file in the collection is. Dead simple: a record type with two columns: name of type VARCHAR2(255) which is in fact the file path and contents of type CLOB.\nThe desired file structure:\n\nHere comes the idea:\n\nWe create a script file to get the file collection, iterate over the collection and modify the content regarding our needs\nTo unload the files with the spool command in SQL*Plus we need it accessible via SQL - therefore we put the files into a global temporary table\nWe need to create an intermediate script file to unload the files (select the clob content)\nWe also need to create host commands for the needed directories because the spool command does NOT create missing directories\nWe spool our progress to a log file for later reference\n\n\nTo run this script file on your operating system, you need a shell script to call it.

Almost exactly three years ago to the day, I wrote my last blog post. Many thanks to Tim Hall and his reminder to write something again for the #JoelKallmanDay.\nIntroduction\nHave you ever been annoyed by the fact that your browser always shows you in red in the URL in your development environment that you have issued the SSL certificate yourself and that it is therefore invalid for it?\nThat doesn’t have to be the case. In addition to the large web servers such as Apache or NGINX, there are many others. One of these is Caddy, which occupies a special position in terms of automatic SSL: It comes with an entire SSL certification authority and can automatically integrate its root certificate into the operating system’s certificate store locally on the computer. Your browser will then no longer complain about an invalid certificate.\nThe only challenge with Caddy is that you need to know how to configure it so that APEX runs properly behind it as a reverse proxy. Unfortunately, this is a bit complicated, not because of Caddy, but because of APEX or ORDS. Let’s put it this way: APEX behind a reverse proxy has its pitfalls. At least if you don’t want to work on the standard port 443.\nIf you want to know more about it, you can find a lot of blog posts about it - mostly about Apache or NGINX. However, I wanted to use Caddy’s fully automatic SSL termination, so I had to look at how it can be done with Caddy using the information available. Special thanks go to my colleague Peter Raganitsch, who helped me a lot both personally and with his blog entry on APEX and NGINX, which is already several years old - here is the link: The Oracle APEX Reverse Proxy Guide using NGINX.\nInstallation\nCaddy is written in Go. The Download only ever includes a single binary file for the respective operating system. Caddy supports plugins to integrate additional functionality into the web server. Manipulating HTTP headers and redirecting URLs is of course basic functionality. Changing the content of the delivered web pages, on the other hand, is a functionality that must be retrofitted using a plugin. Since we need this, we have to initiate a so-called custom build so that the plugin is integrated into the binary file.\nThe download link above has already preselected the plugin. You only have to select the target operating system if it was not recognized correctly. This custom build mode is also the reason why it makes no sense to install Caddy with a package manager such as Homebrew (Mac) or Chocolatey (Windows). After downloading, you should add Caddy to the search path of your operating system to make it easier to access.\nOne more note: Caddy attempts to integrate its root certificate into the operating system’s certificate store at startup. However, this requires libraries from the Network Security Services (NSS), a Mozilla project (see also Wikipedia). If Caddy cannot find these libraries, you will have to import the root certificate from Caddy yourself. I installed the libraries on my Mac with Homebrew (brew install nss) and it worked automatically (of course you will be asked for the admin password for this process). For Linux you can use the respective package manager. There is not really an installation option for Windows. Allegedly it should be enough to have Firefox installed, which then probably comes with the required nss3.dll (I have not verified this, I work with Chromium on a Mac).\nCaddy Configuration\nNow the actual core of the blog post, the configuration. Caddy basically uses a JSON format for its configuration and can also be reconfigured at runtime without restarting via API (another special feature). However, there are a few adapters that can also read other formats when Caddy is started. The best-known format is probably the so-called Caddyfile, which is easier for people to read and write than a highly hierarchical JSON:\n\nThe first block is outside a site and global options are defined in it. Here we place the replace plugin in the correct process order so that it works as desired (order replace after encode, see also the plugin on GitHub).\nThen comes the configuration for our local development server:\n\nlocalhost:8001: If Caddy recognizes a domain (including localhost), a certificate is automatically issued for the domain.\nhandle /ords/*: Starts the configuration for the path /ords/*.\nreverse_proxy http://localhost:7001: We want to forward all /ords/* requests to the ORDS on port 7001.\n\nNow comes the part where I wrote at the beginning that APEX behind a reverse proxy has its pitfalls. In an ideal world, it would not be necessary to tell Caddy more about the reverse proxy directive, as the usual headers are automatically set by Caddy so that the service behind it knows that the request has gone via a proxy server (X-Forwarded-*, see also the documentation on this):\n\nheader_down Location //localhost/ //localhost:8001/: header_down means in the direction of the browser, so we replace all location headers in which the port is missing with the correct information.\nheader_up Host localhost:8001: header_up means direction ORDS, so we tell ORDS what the hostname and port is (unfortunately ORDS does not understand correctly and ignores the port information).\nheader_up +HTTP_X-Forwarded-Port 8001: Note the small plus symbol. This means we are adding this header. I also tried X-Forwarded-Port 8001, but ORDS seems to ignore it. Fortunately, APEX is smart enough to honor the port information from multiple headers, so at least the URLs generated by APEX are correct.\nheader_up -Origin: Here the small minus symbol means that the header should be deleted. We do this so that ORDS does not exit the game with cross origin errors. I actually configured ORDS so that this wouldn’t be necessary, but it didn’t work. If anyone has a better solution, please let me know (see the ORDS configuration below).\nreplace and //localhost/ //localhost:8001/: The same game as before, only this time not with the headers, but with the content of the responses (response body) that the ORDS sends back due to REST calls (mostly JSON data). APEX is completely left out here.\n\nNow standard functionality again:\n\nhandle_path /i/* (and the following two lines): This is where we host our static APEX files such as JavaScript, CSS, etc., so that this does not have to be taken over by ORDS.\nredir /ords /ords/: Here we redirect requests to the correct path without a trailing slash\nredir / /ords/: You should adapt this individually if you want to treat the root directory differently.\n\nIn defense of the ORDS, however, I have to say that you should work with the standard port 443 in a productive environment. This makes the problems behind a proxy much smaller or even disappear. But none of this helps if you can’t fall back on the standard port. In my case, the port depends on which development branch I am currently in. I could be running several instances in parallel, so not every server can want to work on the same port…\nORDS Configuration\nHere is my sample configuration for the ORDS (settings.xml):\n\nThe two most important lines in relation to operation behind a reverse proxy:\n\nThe first line should actually help so that we don’t have to delete the Origin header in the direction of ORDS, but it didn’t work for me. The second line helps ORDS to recognize that the frontend server (reverse proxy) takes over the SSL termination. For a development server where both services run on localhost, I see no reason to secure the connection between the proxy and ORDS. That would go against my goal of using Caddy to benefit from a fully automated SSL solution. The situation is different for production environments, of course. Caddy can also secure the connection to ORDS.\nStart Caddy\nIf you have everything together and your Caddyfile is in the same directory where you start Caddy, then the start command is particularly short:\n\nIf the configuration file is somewhere else:\n\nIf you want to call the configuration file something else, but it is saved in Caddyfile format:\n\nIf you like, you can also register Caddy (and ORDS) as a service in your operating system so that you don’t have to start the servers manually.\nI myself have built a small development server with Node.js, which first generates the configuration files for Caddy and ORDS, then installs ORDS in the PDB (if not already done), and then starts Caddy and ORDS each in a child process. I can then simply terminate both at the same time with Ctrl + C. In addition, a different port is automatically used for each development branch (hence the ports 7001 and 8001 in my examples here, in another branch this could also be 7005 and 8005), so that I can run several instances in parallel (this works well with Git worktrees). So I work very flexibly on the command line and start the required development server with a short command in the respective branch. But that would be a topic for another blog entry.\nConclusion\nI like it when everything looks good on the SSL side of my development environments. Caddy really is a great help in this respect. You could even use Caddy to provide an internal certification server, which then supplies all web servers within a network with certificates. I use this for remote development instances so that I only have to install a single root certificate for all machines. More about this in the official documentation.\nMaybe this blog post will help some of you out there in the wide world.\nHave fun with the Caddy Server :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Forget self-signed certificates and browsers that complain about them","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/caddy-server-and-apex-joel-kallman-day/","path":"/blog/caddy-server-and-apex-joel-kallman-day/","title":"Caddy Server - APEX behind a fully automated SSL proxy #JoelKallmanDay"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/create-fast-insert-scripts/":{"body":"A few weeks ago I released a new version of my PLEX project. I improved the ability to export table data as insert scripts. Previously, PLEX was only able to export CSV data. The reason was that I originally developed PLEX to speed up the implementation of version control in Oracle DB projects, and the ability to export CSV data was intended to track changes in master data tables.\nIt turned out that a colleague of mine wanted PLEX to export insert scripts for all data in all tables for the initial deployment of a new application. I implemented an initial version, but was not happy with the runtime of the insert scripts. I now hear some people arguing that there are better tools than insert scripts for importing larger amounts of data - but sometimes this is the only accepted way because only SQL*Plus is available to run the deployment scripts….\nThen I stumbled across an older post by Connor McDonald on creating fast insert scripts. I have integrated his performance hacks into PLEX.\nYou can use them as follows (see last parameter):\n\nThe p_data_format parameter is new and can contain a comma-separated list of formats - currently the CSV and INSERT formats are supported. An example: csv,insert exports for each table a CSV file and a SQL file with insert statements. For insert you can also specify the number of rows per insert all statement (default value is 20) - example: csv,insert:10 or insert:5.\nAs you can see from the p_data_table_name_not_like =&gt; '%\\_HIST,LOGGER%' parameter, PLEX also accepts lists with like filters. In our example %\\_HIST,LOGGER% is translated to:\n\nFor the parameter p_data_table_name_like =&gt; 'CAT\\_%,USERS,ROLES,RIGHTS' the tables are filtered as follows:\n\nThere is a good reason why the default p_data_max_rows parameter is set to 1000 - if you don’t specify table name filters, all tables will be exported…\nThe resulting insert scripts look like this:\n\nPLEX saves the NLS settings of the current session and makes sure that the insert scripts run with the same settings - this means that you should not get any number or date conversion errors. The performance hacks from Connor are alter session set cursor_sharing = force; and insert all - thanks for pointing that out Connor :-)\nPLEX has many parameters to configure the export - the focus of PLEX is to quickly introduce version control to existing projects (see also this article about PLEX in general). If you want to use PLEX only for exporting table data, then you should create a wrapper function for it that suits your personal needs - here is an example:\n\nNow you can always do a quick export like this: select to_insert('USERS', 10000) from dual;\nHappy exporting and scripting :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"PL/SQL Export Utilities are now able to export table data as insert scripts","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/create-fast-insert-scripts/","path":"/blog/create-fast-insert-scripts/","title":"Create fast insert scripts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/d3js-force-directed-network-chart/":{"body":"\nMy first Oracle APEX plugin and open source project :-)\nEverything started some months ago when I stumbled over this fascinating force-directed graph.

Some months ago I tried to find a way to download a collection of CLOBs or even better a zipped version of the collection as BLOB. I learned that BLOBs are not a valid datatype in SQL*Plus when it comes to the spool command. I found a way by putting the CLOBs into a global temporary table, creating an intermediate SQL script with tons of select and spool commands, and finally spooling the CLOBs one by one by calling the intermediate SQL script. It was working, but far from elegant. Also, when I was in the home office with a less powerful connection, it was slowing down the whole export process significantly.\nIf you are using PLEX (PL/SQL Export Utilities) and this sounds familiar to you - the described method was the default for exporting an APEX app or your schema DDL with the delivered export script templates.\nIf you have no idea what I am talking about: PLEX is a PL/SQL package that is able to export an Oracle APEX app, ORDS modules, all schema objects and table data into a nice directory structure in one go ready to use for version control.

I have no idea why this was not my first solution for the PLEX export templates. In the new version 2.1.0 of PLEX the templates are using this approach. Here is a simplified example.\nFile export.sql:\n\nCongratulations - You are the owner of a base64 encoded CLOB on your client disk. And now? Before you can unzip the file you need to decode it - depending on your operating system you can do this with your OS tools:\n\nWindows: certutil -decode app_100.zip.base64 app_100.zip\nMac: base64 -D -i app_100.zip.base64 -o app_100.zip\nLinux: base64 -d app_100.zip.base64 &gt; app_100.zip\n\nHere a simple Windows batch file, which calls the SQL script above, decodes the file and deletes the base64 version.\nFile export.bat\n\nThe described method to download a BLOB is independent of the package PLEX - you only need a small helper function to encode the BLOB. I found an example provided by Tim Hall on his Oracle Base site.

This can be a very time consuming process when troubleshooting or implementing a new feature.\nSo for my latest open source project, I thought about how to shorten the whole process. I already had a file watcher and a build script running anyway, which, when source files are changed, merges the entire project into a single SQL install script. The plug-in was just about updating a JavaScript file (normal and minified). The PL/SQL code for the plug-in is in a package and only referenced - this is also a good approach for performance reasons (Blog post by Daniel Hochleitner on the topic).\nCreating a template from the existing plug-in\nSo I downloaded the finished plug-in once and stored it as a template in the project directory. Then I looked at how the files are stored in the SQL script of the plug-in:\n\n    \n\n    Example of a file in the SQL installation script of a plug-in\n\nIt looks like we have to encode the files somehow - but how? If you take a closer look at the characters, you will notice at some point that only the digits 0 to 9 and the letters a to f are used. So it seems to be a hexadecimal encoding - with 200 characters in each block.\nOk, then in the template we replace the first anonymous PL/SQL block with a placeholder:\n\n    \n\n    Example of a file in the plug-in template with placeholder\n\nNow we need some code to replace the placeholder with the converted source file.\nJavaScript helper functions for conversion\nSince I implemented the file watcher and other scripts with Node.js/npm, it was obvious to solve this in JavaScript as well. First the needed modules and a md5 hash function:\n\nThen we need a helper function that breaks a string into blocks of 200 characters and returns it as an array:\n\nFinally, our actual function, which hexadecimally encodes a string (read file) and puts it into the required SQL script form:\n\nBuild script to build the plug-in when changes are made in the source code\nEverything is assembled by the build script - here is the relevant snippet:\n\n    \n\n    Example of a build script (excerpt, here the complete script)\n\nIt should be noted that we will also have to manage the file version itself - APEX will install it as we create it. For that purpose, we check by means of hash-function whether JavaScript source file has changed and only then we regenerate the plug-in (including minification). This way, we avoid unnecessarily regenerating the plug-in every time we change source code in the repository and thus incrementing the file version.In the build script snippet above, the current file version and hash value is stored in a JSON file (apexplugin.json, last line of code) so that we can use this as a reference in the next build.\nHere is the relevant place in the plug-in template where the file version is entered by the build script (placeholder #FILE_VERSION#, last parameter):\n\n    \n\n    Plug-in template with placeholders for file and plug-in version (snippet)\n\nIn addition, the version number of the plug-in itself is also updated here (placeholder #CONSOLE_VERSION#, third last parameter) - but this depends on the respective circumstances of the project. In my case I write the version number of the PL/SQL package CONSOLE also into the plug-in depending on it - so if the version number of the package changes, the plug-in will be rebuilt as well. But here everybody has to see what is needed in the project.\nWhen saving source code changes, the file watcher starts and triggers the build script. This then builds two installation SQL scripts together: That of the logging tool itself (not the focus of this article) and then that for the plug-in. Following this, both scripts are then installed in a dev environment. For this, of course, the default workspace stored in the plug-in and the default application number must be present in the dev environment.\nNPM scripts for orchestration\nI now often manage build and install scripts with the node package manager npm. The reason for this is the good integration with Visual Studio Code, the operating system independence and the possibility to orchestrate the scripts a bit - ok, you have to install Node.js, but don’t you always? With one click you can either start the watch task, which does everything automatically with every save of a source file, or you can conveniently call the scripts individually. If someone else looks into the repository, it is also clearer with the npm scripts what works here and how.\n\n    \n    npm script integration in VS Code\n\nIt’s also clear that you don’t write usernames and passwords into the scripts here anymore - that’s already forbidden in principle when the code is checked into version control. On the screenshot you can (hopefully) see that here a wallet with the alias playground is used. For those who only use the instant client and have problems setting up a wallet: How to use mkstore and orapki with Oracle Instant Client.\nThe scripts are managed in the file package.json on the top level of the project directory. If you want to read more about npm scripts, you can start here:\n\nIntroduction to NPM Scripts\nWhy I Left Gulp and Grunt for npm Scripts\nWhy npm Scripts?\n\nA complete example\nFor those who want to see how everything can work together: I took the examples here in the article from my open source project Oracle Instrumentation Console.\nAnother way\nMy focus with this solution was to be able to supply a plug-in locally on the PC with new files. But there is another way: You can upload files or whole directories via script into an installed plug-in of an APEX application and then download the plug-in afterwards. For this purpose there is the Open Souce Project APEX Publish Static Files by Vincent Morneau. This project is also integrated with APEX Nitro which can speed up frontend development in APEX.\nHave fun generating plug-ins :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Instead of uploading new files to a plug-in, we generate the plug-in via a template on the command line and install it","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/generate-apex-plug-ins-on-the-command-line/","path":"/blog/generate-apex-plug-ins-on-the-command-line/","title":"Generate APEX plug-ins on the command line"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/how-to-migrate-oracle-cloud-wallet-into-existing-auto-login-local-wallet/":{"body":"I started to store user credentials in wallet files for higher security in SQL scripts.

But I do not want to install additional software only for two small command-line tools. I found the final hint in an old post from Andriy Dmytrenko. Seems that the two utilities are only shell scripts that are calling some Java libraries. The question was from which location I should take the needed libraries. Since I also have SQLcl on my PC I found the libs there. Below my final shell scripts for Windows - put them somewhere and have the path pointing to the directory where they are stored. If you need them for Linux you will find a way to do it by yourself:\nmkstore.bat:\n\norapki.bat:\n\nIf you need a starter on using mkstore and orapki then Tim Hall from Oracle Base has covered you with an article about the secure external password store.\nHappy password storing :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Create and manage wallets without full client installation","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/how-to-use-mkstore-and-orapki-with-oracle-instant-client/","path":"/blog/how-to-use-mkstore-and-orapki-with-oracle-instant-client/","title":"How to use mkstore and orapki with Oracle Instant Client"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/hydebar/":{"body":"Earlier this year I wrote at the end of this post:\n\nPS: In the meantime I switched complete to Markdown and Jekyll, a static site generator - but this is another story for another post …\n\nAs always - it took a bit longer then expected. In the meantime I was fiddling around with Jekyll and modifying the default theme Minima to my needs. Then I stumbled over the JSDoc theme Minami and the Liquid docs site - both with nice sidebars. I wanted to have such a nice sidebar for my dev blog and began to look deeper how it was implemented. To my surprise the sidebar from the JSDoc theme Minami was complete CSS driven - cool.\nIt took me a while to full understand how it was working. With this knowledge and the design inspirations I was able to improve the Jekyll default theme to a sidebar template. As a bonus I integrated the HTML based slideshow library Reveal.js - you can write now your blog posts and slides with markdown.\nThe nice thing about blogging with markdown is, that you don’t need to switch your tools - you use the usual ones from the daily programming job. It goes even better when you use GitHub: You commit your changes and GitHub takes care about generating your blog content from your sources. And the result is a fast and secure static site.\nI had a accepted talk at the DOAG Conference + Exhibition 2017 in the stream “Strategy &amp; Business Practices” about blogging for developers with Jekyll. Unfortunately short before I had an accident and broke my right upper arm :-(\nMy colleague Markus Dötsch was taking over the presentation and I concentrated on delivering the free time project “Jekyll sidebar template”. This was the working title before I renamed it to “HydeBar” - a play with “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” and the fact, that it is a sidebar template.\nYesterday I released version 1.0.0. You can start blogging for free in five minutes with this quick start guide. The online demo is serving as template, documentation and showcase.

But what if you want to use your browser inline SVGs, generated with some sort of JavaScript and fancy styled with CSS, offline - maybe in a presentation, send by email or printed out large scaled?\nYou can create a screenshot, of course. But does this look nice when it comes to scaling? You can try to copy the HTML code of the SVG and wrap it into a correct SVG container, but then you will loose in the most cases the stylings, as normally not all CSS definitions are directly attached to the SVG elements. You can also use a browser extension like this one for Google Chrome, but then you depend on the browser and the extension.\nThere is now a declarative way with the help of a jQuery plugin, which is 100% client based:\n\nThere is one default option - you can redeclare it:\n\nYou can also set the debug option at runtime:\n\nThe plugin checks if your selector is a SVG element. If this is not the case, it searches under each selector element for all SVGs and exports it. The name(s) of the file(s) are automatically derived from the element ID (or parent element ID) or set to export. The current date and time is appended to the file name, for example example-graph-20170403-154653.svg.\nYou can download all SVGs from one page by setting the selector to the document, body or svg - as you like it.

Furthermore there were hard limits for the amount of text for each editor. Both things which are not so easy to implement with the rich text editor in APEX - no really read only mode and the amount of text is also a problem because of the HTML overhead.\nIt was time to rethink my old implementation and to build a plugin, which creates for each text area with the class markdown an own editor. All other non input elements with a class markdown should simply rendered to HTML, which is then also the solution for the read only mode of the editors. APEX standard text area items supports a read only mode and the class markdown from the text area is also rendered by the APEX engine for this mode :-)\nThe nice side effect is, that I don’t had to reinvent the wheel by creating an own item type - I could reuse the standard APEX text area item and things like the character counter working out of the box.\nYou can find the sources and more informations on GitHub and a demo app on apex.oracle.com.\nHappy coding :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"A dynamic action type plugin","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/markdown-for-oracle-apex/","path":"/blog/markdown-for-oracle-apex/","title":"Markdown for Oracle APEX"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/markdown-reporter/":{"body":"On the APEX connect 2016 in Berlin I talked about my APEX Markdown plugin and fine art printing with the help of Pandoc and LaTeX.

Although it was possible to configure the graph to use the DOM parent width, the responsiveness was not so good because of situations where the window size does not change (we use the window resize event to trigger the change of the width) but the available space for the graph changes. How can the graph react to this?\nThe problem is that a network chart is not a simple image which can be resized according to the available space. The graph is an SVG with multiple layers to handle the zoom and pan, the lasso, a legend that needs to be in a fixed size…   As you can see, there must be a procedural solution. And for this we need a trigger, which always fires when the (possible) size of the graphs parent DOM element changes.\nFortunately, there is a W3C draft for a resize observer and a polyfill available.\nTo put the things together, I had to make breaking changes on the API (the reason for a new major version):\nI made the API zoom methods independent of the option zoomMode and set the default to true for the following options:\n\nzoomToFitOnForceEnd (was false in the past)\nzoomToFitOnResize (new option)\nkeepAspectRatioOnResize (new option)\n\nWhen setting the option useDomParentWidth to true together with the previous mentioned defaults, you can achieve a responsiveness like with images set to width 100%.

In the past it was dependent on APEX for two reasons: The APEX_EXPORT package to allow exporting an APEX app and the APEX_ZIP package for compressing the resulting file collection to a zip file.\nAfter the first public release of PLEX, I got a comment like “Nice tool, but I don’t use APEX”. I thought I should make PLEX independent from APEX to allow at least the export of all the schema DDL and also the table data. Some weeks ago Jürgen Schuster contacted me to try out PLEX for an switch from Subversion to Git for one of his customer projects. It turns out that PLEX was not able to export the schema DDL because of errors from DBMS_METADATA regarding many Java classes. And the second issue was that one of their machines had no APEX installed. This was the final trigger for me to rework the implementation of PLEX.\nPLEX is now independent from an APEX installation. Thanks to Anton Scheffer for his as_zip package. PLEX reuses the methods for compressing files and uses conditional compilation to include/exclude functionality depending on APEX. Because PLEX cannot rely on APEX anymore, the return type for the methods backapp and queries_to_csv has changed from apex_t_export_files to plex.tab_export_files. This was unavoidable and if you have existing scripts and you want to update to the new PLEX version, you have to change the variables based on that return type. A simple search and replace will normally do the trick. This breaking change in the PLEX API is also the reason for a new major version.\nThe other improvement is better error handling and logging. Per default you will find two files in an export collection: plex_runtime_log and plex_error_log. The former is for an overview what happened and how long it took and the latter is for detailed error messages. If you encounter errors and you think that should not happen and is a problem of PLEX, then please open an issue on GitHub.

Some time ago I thought my D3 implementation is more or less feature complete. But in the last weeks I worked again on the code to bring in new feature wishes from the community.\nThe most visible one in the new version 3.1 is the ability to add labels to links - see the links between Allen, Blake and Ward in the screenshot above. The labels are positioned in a way that they are always readable - this is the reason why they appear sometimes above and sometimes below a link line (they are rotated, if needed). The nice thing is that you can also read both labels when you have links in both directions between two nodes. The other benefit of having labels on links is that they extend the area for the link click and hover events. This improves the usabiltiy in cases where the links should show a tooltip when they are hovered or some action should be executed when they are clicked. This is normally not so easy because the links are so narrow.\nThere are also new helper methods and one new option - for the full change log see the project on GitHub and for online demos either the standalone version in the docs or the APEX plug-in version on apex.oracle.com.\nHappy networking :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Links can now have a label","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/new-version-of-d3-force-network-chart-available/","path":"/blog/new-version-of-d3-force-network-chart-available/","title":"New Version of D3 Force Network Chart Available"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/new-version-of-oracle-table-api-generator-available/":{"body":"Short before Christmas André and I released version 0.6.0 of our table API generator. The last release was exactly two years ago - time flies. This blog post highlights some of the changes - the complete changelog is available on GitHub.\nBulk Processing\nWhen you split your app over multiple schemas for higher data security you might need at some point the possibility to bulk process your data. Imagine the following, common schema setup (also see this nice video by Connor McDonald, 20 minutes):\n\nData Schema: Holds your tables and provides table APIs for the other schemas, which have only select rights on the tables (or views) and execute rights on the table APIs\nAPI Schema: Holds your business logic and provides business APIs to the app parsing schema\nUI Schema: Has no own objects, only connect rights and is used as the parsing schema to run the application\n\nThis setup follows the principle of the least privilege. When you need to bulk process your data in the business logic (API schema), then you have a problem without bulk processing facilities in your table APIs. You need to implement business logic in the data schema or you grant update and/or delete rights to the API schema. The first solution is against the separation of concerns and the second one lowers your data security and maybe prevents you from not having triggers (more about this later in the audit columns section).\nThat is why we have now also bulk processing in the core of our generated table APIs. Here is how you can use it in your business logic:\n\n\nThe bulk deletion works the same way as the bulk update - the difference is that you do not modify your data before calling the delete_rows method.\nFor more examples see the docs:\n\nBasic usage\nPerformance tests\n\nSupport for Audit Columns\nKeeping the bulk processing in mind for performance reasons it is a bad idea to have triggers only to manage audit columns in a table. If you have your tables in an own schema and the business logic and the app cannot directly write to the tables then it is easy to prevent triggers. Therefore the table APIs need to support that and hides the audit columns for insert or update operations. This is what our generator now supports.\nYou can map your specific audit column names to the four often used names created, created_by, updated and updated_by by providing a mapping string to the new parameter p_audit_column_mappings - an example:\n\nThe #PREFIX# in our example is optional (determined automatically by the generator) and replaced with the found column_prefix au. Doing it this way you can provide always the same audit column mapping to all of your tables. I know some people hate column prefixes - but if you design your data models this way the generator can save you the work to align the mapping for each table.\nSupport for a Row Version Column\nThe same reasons with triggers for the audit columns are valid for the support of a row version column. This can also be handled by our generator:\n\nYou can also see here the before mentioned #PREFIX# substitution. The difference is that you define here only your column and for the column the SQL expression which should be used for the row version column - in this case, a sequence.\nWhat we cannot do here is to add always 1 to the previous value like it is possible in a trigger - the table API has no idea what the previous value was. So, we are a little bit limited to a SQL expression but the point is, you can let the generated API manage the row version column without having a trigger.\nTenant Support\nThis is the third new column mapping definition. For all people who have not an enterprise version with the VPD (virtual private database) functionality you can define a tenant expression for one of your columns:\n\nFor more information see the parameter docs for p_tenant_column_mapping.\nMore\n\nA new optional 1:1 view can be generated (new parameter p_enable_one_to_one_view)\nAll generated object names can now be customized (new parameters p_dml_view_name, p_dml_view_trigger_name and p_one_to_one_view_name)\nDouble quoting of table and column names in the generated code can now be configured (new parameter p_double_quote_names, default true)\nA new helper function get_default_row will be generated, when parameter p_enable_column_defaults is set to true (to support the row based create_row function)\nWe have now unit tests driven by utPLSQL (it will be a permanent task to improve the tests with every new feature or bugfix)\n\nBreaking Changes\nWhere there is light, there is also shadow.\nAll the new features like bulk processing and audit column support make it hard, if not impossible, to generate a generic change log during the row processing. Also the check, if we have a modification and omit an update if not necessary is hard to implement and not good for the performance with the evolved generator. So we skipped the mentioned functionality.\nAs far as we know not many people use the generic changelog. If you do, you have to stick with the previous generator version or you have to find an alternative way to do it in the future. A good way seems to be the use of the Flashback Data Archive as it is performant and available in all database editions for free - and you can load existing data into the archive (see Tims article below):\n\nBlog post by Connor McDonald: Triggers can provide auditing information, but there’s a future in flashback\nBlog post by Tim Hall: Flashback Data Archive (FDA) Enhancements in Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1)\nVideo by Connor McDonald: Flashback Data Archive (14 minutes)\nVideo APEX Connect 2020 by Connor McDonald: Flashback – so much more (47 minutes)\nVideo AskTOM Office Hours by Chris Saxon: The Incredible Flashback Data Archive (53 minutes)\n\nAnd the last Breaking change is, that you need at least Oracle DB 12.1 or higher. That should (hopefully) no problem for the most projects.\nConclusion\nA big THANK YOU to all contributors - the current version of the generator would not be possible without your feedback and help.\nBe sure to test the new generator before migrating to it. We use it already in some projects and it should be pretty stable. Nevertheless, with so many changed things we cannot give you a guarantee for every edge case - by using it you accept the MIT license. Please check out the project page at GitHub and open an issue if you encounter a problem.\nA happy new year and happy coding :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Bulk processing, support for audit and row version columns and more","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/new-version-of-oracle-table-api-generator-available/","path":"/blog/new-version-of-oracle-table-api-generator-available/","title":"New Version of Oracle Table API Generator Available"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/ora11xe-install-file-swap-check-disabler/":{"body":"Many people have problems to install Oracle 11XE in a Docker environment because the install file checks the available swap space in the container.

Under Windows you have no chance and you have to do it by yourself because for license reasons everyone has to download his/her own copy of the install file from Oracle OTN.\nI came up with the idea to simply do all the steps in a Docker container under the same Linux (oraclelinux:7-slim) which is later on needed with the official Oracle Docker file for an XE instance.

The nice thing is, that the EPG don’t need to serve the images and I also don’t need to install the images into the EPG, when I upgrade to a newer APEX version.

It was created to be able to quickstart version control for existing (APEX) apps. It currently has two main functions called backapp and queries_to_csv. queries_to_csv is used by BackApp as a helper function, but its functionality is also useful as a standalone. This post is all about BackApp, which has the following features:\n\nExport the app definition of an APEX app (splitted files and optional single SQL file)\nExport all ORDS modules from the current schema\nExport all object DDL from the current schema\nExport table data into CSV files\nProvide basic script templates for export/import of whole app for DEV, TEST and PROD\nEverything in a (hopefully) nice directory structure ready to use with version control\nReturn value is a file collection of type plex.tab_export_files (it was apex_t_export_files before PLEX version 2) for further processing\n\nEach file in the collection is represented by a record with two columns\n\nname of type VARCHAR2(255), which is in fact the file path\ncontents of type CLOB\n\n\nYou can optionally zip the file collection with the helper function to_zip\nAlso see the my previous post on how to handle the apex_t_export_files type returned by the APEX_EXPORT package with SQL*Plus\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nDownload the latest code\nRun the provided install script plex_install.sql (provides compiler flags) in your desired schema - could also be a central tools schema, don’t forget grant execute on plex to xxx\nStartup your favorite SQL Tool, connect to your app schema and fire up the following query:\n\n\nSave the resulting BLOB file under a name with the extension .zip and extract it to a local directory of your choice. You will find this directory structure and files:\n\nIf you like, you can fully configure your first export into the zip file. The plex.backapp method has boolean parameters, so you need to use an inline function in a pure SQL context. You can also use an anonymous PL/SQL block or you create a small SQL wrapper for the method like the inline function of the example. All parameters are optional and listed here with their default values:\n\nATTENTION: Exporting all database objects can take some time. I have seen huge runtime differences from 6 seconds for a small app up to several hundred seconds for big apps and/or slow databases. This is normally not the problem of PLEX. If you are interested in runtime statistics of PLEX, you can inspect the delivered plex_runtime_log.md in the root directory.\nAlso, the possibility to export the data of your tables into CSV files does not mean that you should do this without thinking about it. The main reason for me to implement this feature was to track changes on catalog tables by regularly calling this export feature with a sensitive table filter and max rows parameter as catalog data is often relevant in business logic.\nIf you have organized your app into multiple schemas as described in The Pink Database Paradigm, you may need to export database objects from more then one schema. This is no problem for plex.backapp as all parameters are optional - you can simply logon to your second or third schema and extract only the DDL for these schemas by omitting the p_app_id parameter and setting p_include_object_ddl to true. Then unload the DDL files into a different directory - for example app_backend_schemaName.\nA last word: you should inspect all the exported files and scripts and check if this solution can work for you. If not, please let me know what is missing or what should be done in a different way …\nFeedback is welcome - simply create a new issue at the GitHub project page\nNext Steps\nIt is up to you how you organize the version control repository and how often you export your APEX app or object DDL. I would follow the files first approach and extract the object DDL only ones to have a starting point. The APEX application needs regular exports - if you like, you can automate this.\nFollowing the files first approach is sometimes not easy when you are using low code tools like Quick SQL and Blueprint in APEX or code generators like OraMUC’s Table API Generator. There could be a need to regularly extract (maybe unknown) objects (not created by yourself) into version control to understand and document what you got from others (people or generators)…\nIf the directory structure provided by PLEX does not match your needs - no problem - you can align it. Simply loop over the returned file collection and do your necessary work - here an example:\n\nFor unloading the resulting file collection with SQL*Plus, please have a look in the scripts/templates folder of your export - there are examples to do this. See also my previous post on how to handle the apex_t_export_files type returned by the APEX_EXPORT package with SQL*Plus.\nSome people prefer to devide their DDL scripts into the two categories restartable (like packages) and run once (like tables). Others like to have their scripts in a way that they are always restartable and the DDL script itself takes care about doing the work only once when needed. The advantage of the second way is that your backend install/deployment script is always the same and it simply calls all objects DDL scripts.\nThere is no right or wrong in doing it this or that way - each project/team has its specific requirements and history. The important thing is, that you start to use a version control system to be able to log your changes and document your code.\nBy the way - PLEX provides script templates and object DDL that follows the second approach: You can always have the same install/deployment script and the DDL scripts are restartable - check it out by looking in one of your exported table DDL scripts.\nYou are now at the point where PLEX can’t do anything more for you. If you like to export your object DDL scripts more often, you have to find a way to be able to protect some of your scripts against overwriting. Imagine you had to add two columns to a table and you provided a restartable alter statement for this in the existing DDL script. If you export this table script the next time with PLEX (or with dbms_metadata.get_ddl, which is used in the background), your alter statements are gone and the new columns are simply listed in the create table statement. With this script you are not be able to deploy your changes to TEST or PROD.\nOne solution is to copy the original table script and name it e.g. EMPLOYEES.dev.sql. In this script you maintain the restartable alter statements. If you run plex.backapp again you are overwrite save. The script EMPLOYEES.sql reflects your current table definition and can still be executed - it does nothing because the table is already existing. The script EMPLOYEES.dev.sql reflects your development history and need to be added to your custom install/deployment script.\nAs you can see, PLEX can do only the basics for you. It is up to the developers how they manage their version control repository and how they do their deployments - there are thousends of ways to do it …\nInspirations / Further Reading\nThanks are going to:\n\nAndré Borngräber for his ability to think and discuss database topics in deep details\nBlain Carter for his thoughts on CI/CD for Database Developers – Export Database Objects into Version Control\nMarkus Dötsch for the first BackApp tests and cross-reading the first version of this post\nMartin D’Souza for his time and the interesting discussion about code generation and version control at the APEX Connect 2018 in Düsseldorf, Germany and his blog post Exporting APEX Application in SQLcl with Build Status Override - plex.backapp has now a parameter for this ;-)\nPhilipp Salvisberg for his thoughts on The Pink Database Paradigm\nSamuel Nitsche for his thoughts on There is no clean (database) development without Version Control\nTim Hall for his article about Generating CSV Files\n\nThats It\nHopefully PLEX is usefull for someone else.\nHappy coding, apexing, version controlling :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Export Oracle APEX app, ORDS modules, all schema objects and table data in one go","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/plex-plsql-export-utilities/","path":"/blog/plex-plsql-export-utilities/","title":"PLEX - PL/SQL Export Utilities"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/ploc-plsql-code-to-doc-converter/":{"body":"\nSome months ago I had to write a README file with Markdown syntax for a PL/SQL open source project. I changed function and procedure parameters of the package often during the implementation. Therefore, maintaining the documentation was no fun in the beginning. Maybe you know this from your own (payed) projects ;-)\nNormally in the business world I see minimalistic comments in the code and a dedicated documentation independent of the code. As you can imagine, the latter is sometimes - let’s say “out of date”, if it exists at all …\nI don’t want to discuss the reasons for this here - you all know several ones. And I also do not have a general solution for code documentation.

Some of the tools can automatically document a whole schema - that is not the focus of PLOC. Most comparable is the intention of PL/SQL to Markdown  Documenter.\nSo I had to do it by myself. I called it PLOC (PLDoc was already used, so I skipped the D…) and it is implemented in JavaScript as a npm package and currently used by me for the following two projects: PL/SQL Export Utilities and Oracle Table API Generator. It is very lightweight - the main code without the CLI has currently less characters as the Markdown source of this blog post. Maybe it is also useful for you.

The reasons for this are manifold. Mostly it is assumed that the database is a safe place for the source code. With a working backup this is also correct, but in any case one loses the complete history of changes. Often in running projects there is not enough time to deal with the introduction of source code versioning, because at first sight there is no direct benefit to be seen. Who dares to take a second look under time pressure? This article wants to lower the hurdle for the introduction of a version management a little bit.\nNote DOAG\nThis article appeared in DOAG Red Stack magazine 03-2019 and is also available in the german original. Unlike the original, updates may occur here on my blog if relevant things change. For example, since version two of the mentioned PLEX (PL/SQL Export Utilities) project, an APEX installation is no longer a requirement. This means that also pure Oracle database projects can use PLEX - read more in this blog entry.\nIntroduction\nThe first step is the most important one, as everyone knows who has ever finally set out after much hesitation - whatever it was about. The same is true for source code versioning. Once you’re on your way, you wonder how you got along for so long without it. A versioned source code base increases your comfort zone during development, and the time invested pays off several times over. But how do you take the first step as easily and quickly as possible? How to design the structure of a repository?\nWorkflow change: file-based working\nOne of the most important questions is: Can I continue to work as before? The answer depends entirely on how one has worked so far. Basically, working with a source code versioning also means a change away from developing in the database. Changing and compiling code directly in the database or changing tables with the tool of one’s choice must evolve to file-based work. This means working with a file in the local source code repository with the tool of choice. The changes are then compiled from the file. For schema changes, scripts must contain the necessary DDL code. Depending on the tools used so far, this is rather a subtle difference when editing logic, but a big difference when changing database objects like tables. If a schema diff tool was previously used to transport changes from the development environment into production, then this might even look like a step backwards at first glance.\nThe point here is that you can only get a usable source code history if you are consistent about working file-based. There can also be an intermediate step towards this approach. One continues to work as before and regularly exports all objects of the schema to the source code management. This way one gets at least a certain ordered transparency of the changes. If then in the course of the project the advantages of this procedure become apparent, one usually still lacks the information, who executed the respective changes. In addition, the transparency gained quickly awakens desires such as “If I have the old code in the repository, then I may try something, I can go back if necessary”. The first hurdle is already taken and the openness to perhaps really get started is there.\nThat something like this can work even better is something that most developers come up with themselves. For example, creating a branch (development branch) in the local repository. This way you can try something out without running the risk of having to discard your changes due to an unexpected bug. You can easily switch to the main (parallel) branch, work on the bugfix, update your branch to the changed main branch and then just keep trying. All this without the danger of losing things or influencing other colleagues. Have I lost anyone now? No problem, just get started - only practice helps here.\nTool comparison: DDL export\nHow do you accomplish the first step? How do you export the schema objects of your application into a well sorted directory structure? Most of the used graphical development tools provide an export function for this purpose. Depending on the tool, this is more or less suitable for building a source code repository. Therefore, let’s take a look at how the most commonly used tools SQL Developer, PL/SQL Developer and Toad can do this. A word beforehand: the intention of the schema export of these tools is actually to bring the objects into another schema, maybe even into another database, and not to create a source code repository. The following questions move us when it comes to building one:\n\nIs one script file per object possible?\nAre subdirectories per object type possible?\nAre separate files for foreign keys possible? (Useful for simpler master scripts)\nCan “Object already exist” errors be prevented? (Or in other words: are the scripts restartable?)\nCan data be exported? (If possible in CSV format for tracking master data changes).\nIs it possible to export an APEX app? (Possibly also broken down into the individual parts such as pages, shared components, etc.)\n\nFigure 1 shows the result related to the question.\n\n    CriterionSQL Dev.PL/SQL Dev.Toad\nFile per objectYesYesYes\nSubdir. per typeYesNoYes\nFK constr. separateYesNoYes\nPrevent “object exist”NoNoNo\nExport dataYesNopartly\nExport APEX apppartlyNoNo\n\n\n    Figure 1: Tool comparison DDL export\n\nNotes on SQL Developer:\n\nIs the clearest\nMany formats for data export (also CSV)\nExtensively configurable\nExport APEX App only with Commandline version SQLcl\n\nNotes on PL/SQL Developer:\n\nLittle configurable\nDisappointing for building a source code repository\n\nNotes on Toad:\n\nTwo export options (at least).\n\nEither subdirectories per object type….\n… or data\n\n\nData only as insert statements\nExtensively configurable, relatively unclear\n\nNone of the tools provides us with a ready-made, well-structured source code repository. You have to do more or less a lot of rework. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, especially since sorting the objects into a reasonable structure should be a one-time job. Only in the case of exporting the APEX application one would like to have an automatic solution, because this export will have to be done more often in the future. This is in the nature of APEX as a declarative “low code framework”.\nWe develop the APEX application in the browser and the meta-data of the application resides in the APEX repository of the database. An export of the application can also be done with the browser, but in doing so you will only get a single large SQL file with the entire application. Desirable for a source code repository would be an export of the individual parts such as pages, shared components, plugins, etc.. This would then make it possible for the application to track how it has developed and also a search in the repository for e.g. a specific package call makes much more sense with a disassembled APEX application. In the past, you could use the APEX export splitter for this, basically a Java class that comes with every APEX version to this day. The disadvantage is that you have to take the directory structure as created by the splitter or you change it afterwards with local scripts on your PC. However, it would be nicer to be able to adjust the directory structure already during the export in order to be able to store all master scripts in a central folder of the repository.\nSince APEX version 5.1.4 there is the APEX_EXPORT package for this purpose. With this package you can export either the whole script or the splitted version. The return format in both cases is a collection - each line of the collection contains a path specification for the respective export file and a CLOB field with the content. So you could edit this collection in an export script and adapt the path specifications to your own needs. This is exactly what the tool package PLEX, published as open source by the author of this article, does - the name stands for PL/SQL Export Utilities. Furthermore, PLEX can answer yes to any of the above questions about DDL export - no wonder, it was designed for that.\nQuickstart: Package PLEX\nPLEX aims to be able to select the first version of the repository as a BLOB with a simple query. After saving the BLOB to the local directory system on the PC with the extension .zip you can unpack it and find in the generated directory structure script examples for future semi- or fully automatic exports and deployments via shell command or SQL*Plus. A possible first export could look like shown in Listing 1.\n\n    \n\n    Listing 1: Possible first export\n\nSince PLEX has boolean parameters, we use an inline function in the with clause. If you use a database version smaller than 12c, you can create an auxiliary function similar to the example. PLEX has some more parameters to configure e.g. the APEX App Export. More details can be found on the official project page at github.com/ogobrecht/plex. Depending on the size of the schema and the APEX app, this initial call can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. This is because in the background for each object the package DBMS_METADATA is used to generate the DDL of the object. If you are interested in runtime information, you will find a log file in the main directory of the export with information about what PLEX did and how long the respective steps took. PLEX itself now exists in a first version - suggestions for improvements or bug reports are welcome and can be reported as issues on the project page.\nFrom here on it strongly depends on the needs of the respective project if and how often you run a DDL export. The normal way should be a regular export of the APEX application. Everything else should be processed locally from now on and as a result there should be no need for an export. However, as mentioned at the beginning, there may be situations where you regularly export all schema objects in order to document the application. However, this should only be seen as an intermediate step towards a file-based way of working.\nGenerated code is a special case: So for example using Quick-SQL in APEX or generating table APIs. Here one can consider exporting the generated code with appropriately configured object filters. For APIs you should consider versioning the generator instead of the generated code - but this depends entirely on whether the generated code is still being manually modified or not. Any manually generated code should be versioned.\nGeschwindigkeit: Immer Skripte\nAs you can already see from the script examples provided by PLEX, the goal should be to execute any deployment by script. This also includes the consideration to export the object DDL only at the very first time - because what happens e.g. when exporting table DDL? If you have written another column into the table script via Alter Table statement and made sure that it is restartable (see Listing 2), then another DDL export overwrites the Alter statement and our table script simply contains the new column listed in the Create Table statement. However, this is never executed again due to the restartability, since our table already exists.\n\n    \n\n    Listing 2: Restartable script\n\nThus, we now have a source code file that is no longer suitable for deployment. A pity actually, because until just now we could have simply called all object scripts with our master script and only the changes (like our new column) would really have been executed - a simple deployment and a clear history in the repository. This is contrasted with the automatic creation of diff scripts, which are sometimes not restartable and risk data loss even with slightly more complicated schema changes. One cannot avoid checking the generated scripts for correctness and making manual adjustments for any data migrations, even with very expensive tools of this class. No one takes the decision of which way to go away from you. Now we are in the middle of the discussion on how to deploy to the target system. PLEX can’t help here either - except that the package per se tries to extract all necessary object DDLs in a way that they can be restarted. Here we are in the wide field of individual needs of a project. The script examples supplied by PLEX must be adapted to the needs of the respective project in any case. For example, the author almost always distinguishes between scripts for the backend and the frontend - both for export and deployment.\nConsideration: Directory structure in the repository\nHow should you structure your repository? Here is a suggestion that has proven to be beneficial for me personally over time. Every project may have different ideas. I use a simple listing here - the first words of each list item represent the directory name, and any explanations are in parentheses after it:\n\napp_backend (our schema DDL)\n\nconstraints (one folder per object type)\npackage_bodies\npackages\nref_constraints\nsequences\ntables\n…\n\n\napp_data (tracking of master data, optional)\napp_frontend (our APEX app)\n\npages\nshared_components\n…\n\n\ndocs (the documentation)\nreports\nscripts (all master scripts combined)\n\nlogs (export and installation logs)\n\nexport_app_100_from_MYSCHEMA_at_DEV_20190315_132542\ninstall_app_100_into_MYSCHEMA_at_TEST_20190318_083756\n…\n\n\nmisc (frequently used scripts like recompile schema)\n1_export_app_from_DEV.bat (shell script with parameters for the actual SQL export script)\n2_install_app_into_TEST.bat (Shell script with parameters for the SQL deployment script)\n3_install_app_into_PROD.bat (shell script with parameters for the custom SQL deployment script)\nexport_app_custom_code.sql (export master script with customizations)\ninstall_app_custom_code.sql (Deployment Master Script with individual customizations per release)\ninstall_backend_generated_by_plex.sql (called from master script)\ninstall_frontend_generated_by_apex.sql (called by the master script)\n\n\ntests (unit and frontend tests)\nREADME.md (general information about the project and links to the documentation)\n\nThe repository should be logically structured and not contain extremely deep directory structures to make it easier to use. All master scripts are united in one script folder, also the installation script generated by APEX for the frontend. All master scripts should store their respective feedback in corresponding log files in the logs subfolder during use - this makes exports of source code and deployments to target systems traceable.\nOutlook: CI/CD &amp; Schema Migration\nThe outlined discussion of deployment already hints at it: Simply setting up a source code repository and you’re done is not the solution. That was just the first step to warm up. Once you have structured everything and made it executable via script, you can automate the deployment in the second step. The content of this discussion is far beyond the scope of this article, which focuses on the first step. Therefore, the author suggests everyone not to stop after this first step and to consider further steps. Martin Fowler, for example, has written a very good basic article on the subject - he considers every change to the database as a migration. For further study, the following entry points should therefore be mentioned:\n\nAntti Kirmanen: Git vs. Subversion (SVN): Welches Versionskontrollsystem sollten Sie nutzen?\nMartin Fowler: Evolutionary Database Design\nSamuel Nitsche:\n\nThere is no clean (database) development without Version Control\n“One does not simply update a database” – migration based database development\n\n\nBlain Carter:\n\nTips to help PL/SQL developers get started with CI/CD\nCI/CD for Database Developers – Export Database Objects into Version Control\n\n\nJeff Smith: 19.X SQLcl Teaser: LIQUIBASE\n\nHappy version controlling :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"DOAG Red Stack Magazin 03-2019","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/quick-start-version-control-for-oracle-projects/","path":"/blog/quick-start-version-control-for-oracle-projects/","title":"Quick start - version control for existing Oracle projects"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/sample-data-sets-for-oracle/":{"body":"Sometimes you need only some small tables and some rows of data to play around with, to test things out.

Only changed values should be stored and all tables should log into the same generic logging table. Sounds like we need a generator for this.\nUnfortunately there was no time in the project to create such a generator from the ground. Luckily André, a colleague of me, had started to implement such an API generator in his free time and I had only to implement the generic change log functionality - also in my free time. Our API generator open source project was born :-)\nLater on I needed a function to get the id from an record by the unique columns - next feature for the API generator: generate a (overloaded) function for each unique constraint on a table. Now it is a simple function call to get the id:\n\nThe API is also handling the case, when no data is found and everything without the need to look in the dictionary for the unique columns of that table or to write boilerplate code and possibly forget one column.\nThe next thing for APEX was “For tabular forms you can’t use APIs”. We came up with the idea to generate a view for each table with an instead of trigger for inserts, updates and deletions. The trigger is simply calling the API. Now you can use APEX own “automatic row processing” and the generic logging together.\nIn my holiday this spring I stumbled over a tweet from Phillip Salvisberg about his oddgen project, a SQL Developer extension to invoke dictionary-driven code generators. I was thrilled, we can have a SQL Developer integration by writing a small PL/SQL wrapper for oddgen. I finished the integration in my holiday, I could not wait.\nOver the time we found out, that the generation of the thin API wrappers for our tables saves us time and makes our code more stable and readable because of the saved boilerplate code.\nBusiness logic packages becomes invalid after table changes and API regeneration. This is good, because you can see, which API calls are now invalid. If you have simple insert or update statements you might oversee some places, where the statement is still valid for example with an added table column, but in fact does the wrong insert or update.\nAnd the last thing, what is now possible: Security - separate the data from the user interface. Simply grant execute rights on the API and business logic packages to the UI schema and disable the deletion of rows in your API packages when you don’t need it. No user will be able to drop or truncate your tables, because there are no tables in the UI schema.\nThe generated API packages are really thin - nothing special at all. Nevertheless they are powerful time savers.\nYou can find the sources and more informations on GitHub.\nHappy coding :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"An Oracle PL/SQL package with SQL Developer integration","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/table-api-generator/","path":"/blog/table-api-generator/","title":"Table API Generator"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/today-button-in-apex-datepicker/":{"body":"Maxime Tremblay has already described here how to customize the datepicker.\nHe had to deal with missing classes after changing options.

This behaviour is described in the HTML 2.0 specification (section 8.2).\nTo workaround this you can simply create a second input item and hide it by setting the “HTML Form Element Attributes” to style=\"display:none;\". This was also posted by Denes Kubicek back in 2008.\nI like the idea of one of the Stack Overflow comments to put anywhere into the form (in APEX in fact the whole page, e.g. the header or footer of a region) this HTML snippet and not to create an “useless” page item:\n\nIt is worth to mention that I run the newest Chrome browser and this “feature” is still available…\nHappy coding :-)\nOttmar\n","description":"Why forms with a single input field are submitted by the enter key","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/why-forms-with-single-input-are-submitted-by-the-enter-key/","path":"/blog/why-forms-with-single-input-are-submitted-by-the-enter-key/","title":"Form Behaviour - Bug or Feature?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1025/blog/why-i-like-sqlplus-for-deployment-scripts/":{"body":"The following simplified example deployment master script is given:\n\nWhen we call this in SQL*Plus (version 19.5), we get the following output (in\nthe console and also in deployment.log) with an indication of what went wrong\nwith our deployment:\n\nOk, this error message is stupid, but usually, I get some useful information\nhere to fix my problem in the deployment script - especially when the\nproblematic script is a bit longer…\nWhen we call this in SQLcl (latest version 19.4 on Windows) we get the following\noutput (in the console and also the deployment.log):\n\nMhhh… What was going on here?

There are already some free tools on the market and probably many that have never been released (DOAG talk by Sabine Heimsath on the topic):\n\nLogger\nPIT\nInstrumentation for PLSQL\nLog4plsql\nILO\nBMC_DEBUG\n…\n\nOne reason seems to be that everyone has different ideas or needs. For me, I wanted a logging tool that is very easy to install and works even if you are not allowed to create a context in the database and also have no special read permissions for administrative views like v$session. You only need the rights to create tables and packages and optionally a cleanup job - pretty standard. Nevertheless, it is possible to move individual users/sessions to a higher log level for debugging purposes. As this is solved via client identifier, this will also work in an environment without fixed session ID like e.g. APEX. If no client identifier is set in an environment, then Console simply assigns one itself. Console reads its configuration from a table with only one line supported by the result cache. This ensures a resource-saving execution. Also the check whether a log message is really written to the log table based on the current log level is highly optimized to keep the overhead as low as possible in production environments.\nA single install script\nFor Console, all scripts are merged into a single install script. Since SQLcl can also load scripts from the Internet, you could install the tool in a minute without downloading it first: Invoke SQLcl, log into the desired schema, and call @https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogobrecht/console/main/install/create_console_objects.sql. A few seconds later you can start logging. If you want to install it in APEX and only have browser access to your development environment, the single install script in SQL Workshop is also very helpful and Console installs quickly.\nProduction safe without further configuration\nConsole logs only errors (level 1) by default. This means that you are on the safe side on production systems without any further configuration. But if you want to enable other levels like warning (2), info (3), debug (4) or trace (5) on a development system and don’t want to do this for each session individually, you can set it globally: exec console.conf(p_level =&gt; 3);. More about this in the package description for the procedure console.conf.\nTo set a session (client identifier) to a higher log level use the procedure console.init. If you omit the parameter p_client_identifier, then the client identifier of your own session is automatically taken - here is an example:\n\nNow the question arises, how to get the client identifier of a foreign session without read access to adminstrative views like e.g. v$session. A variant would be to write this for example in the frontend of an application with sys_context('USERENV', 'CLIENT_IDENTIFIER') - e.g. in the footer or on a help page.\nIf you want to return to the normal mode of global settings for all sessions, you can do so with console.exit.\nYou should not use the procedures console.conf, init and exit in your business logic - they are only used for managing session settings and for debugging purposes and should therefore only be used interactively or in SQL scripts.\nMethod names based on JavaScript Console\nConsole uses as many method names from the JavaScript Console as possible - so switching between backend code and frontend code shouldn’t be that hard as far as method names are concerned. Whether the methods really write anything to the log table CONSOLE_LOGS depends on the active log level - so first these:\n\nLevel 1: Error\nLevel 2: Warning\nLevel 3: Info\nLevel 4: Debug (instead of verbose in the JavaScript Console)\nLevel 5: Trace (not available in the JavaScript Console)\n\nThe main instrumentation methods:\n\nconsole.error_save_stack (more on that in a moment):\nconsole.error (level error)\nconsole.warn (level warning)\nconsole.info &amp; log (level info)\nconsole.debug (level debug)\nconsole.trace (level trace)\nconsole.count &amp; count_reset\nconsole.count_current &amp; count_end (level info)\nconsole.count_current &amp; count_end (function overloads, independent of log level)\nconsole.time &amp; time_reset\nconsole.time_current &amp; time_end (level info)\nconsole.time_current &amp; time_end (function overloads, independent of log level)\nconsole.table# (level info)\nconsole.assert &amp; assertf\nconsole.format\nconsole.add_param\n\nMore in the API overview.\nReduced amount of log entries through saved call stack\nConsole uses the capabilities of the utl_call_stack package to reduce the number of log entries to a possible minimum. Who doesn’t know the problem: In case of an error, a log entry is created in each sub-function to record as many details as possible. In the end you have to watch how the log table gets cluttered and you try to find out from the many log entries where exactly the error occurred.\nIt would be helpful to see the method names in the error backtrace - but the database only writes the package names and the line number in the backtrace. To work around this problem Console offers the possibility instead of writing an error in the submethods into the log table, to save the call stack with the call console.error_save_stack until finally in the outermost main method console.error is called, which then enters the error including saved call stack into the log table. For clarification, here is a script with a test package:\n\nHere is the output of the above script - the Saved Error Stack section is Console’s special feature, the other three stack and trace sections are the database’s standards:\n\nIf you don’t use console.error_save_stack but always console.error, then you get at least the last three sections in the log - and without extra work in the code. You just have to remember console.error.\nSimple logging of method parameters\nConsole also provides a simple way to log method parameters. Here is a sample procedure with parameters of all supported types:\n\nIn the exception handling you can see nicely that you always call the same procedure console.add_param and pass the name and the value. The parameters are cached in an array in the console package (shortened to a maximum of 2000 characters) and taken over with the next call of a log method (error, warn, info, log, debug or trace). If you don’t want the parameters to be truncated, you are free to write the parameter directly into the log message - this is of type clob and is therefore not subject to any size restrictions.\nHere an example call of the above procedure:\n\nThis call then writes the following log message - see the MESSAGE column:\n\nMarkdown format for automatically determined metadata\nThe attentive reader might not have missed that the above log message is formatted in Markdown. So, if you like, you can have your report rendered accordingly in HTML (e.g. in APEX) - however, it is well readable in text form, too. The Markdown table format as in the example above is also used by Console for logging other metadata such as APEX environment, CGI environment, user environment and console environment. All of these environments can be turned on for each individual log call. They are then appended to the log message like the parameters. Here exemplarily the signature of the error procedure:\n\nExtensible logs through overloaded log methods\nThe error procedure has an overload in the form of a function that returns the log ID. Thus one can extend the logging also with own data in own tables e.g. for a downstream release process in case of specific errors. This is also the purpose of the p_permanent parameter, which ensures that the cleanup job or the console.purge and console.purge_all procedures do not delete the correspondingly marked log entries and that these are permanently available. All other log methods (warn, info, log, debug, trace) are implemented in the same way and with the same parameters - but some have different default values. For the error method the call stack is written, for the trace method all four environment details.\nThe parameters p_user_agent, p_user_scope, p_user_error_code and p_user_call_stack are intended to be able to capture external log events as well and to overwrite the automatically determined values of the PL/SQL environment. As an example an external load process in a data warehouse or error messages from the JavaScript frontend of an application can be mentioned. With a little imagination, everyone will come up with their own use cases here…\nMeasure time and count things\nMeasuring execution times and counting things are very common functions. Console can help here to not have to create too many helper variables and keep the code short and sweet. For this purpose it offers the procedures time, count and other helpers. You can easily run several timers or counters in parallel - they are each identified by an optional label. If you omit the label, then internally the label is default. The best way to illustrate this is a bit of sample code:\n\nThis will result in the following log messages in the console_logs table if the current log level is 3 (info) or higher:\n\ndefault: 00:00:00.102508\nmyTimer: 00:00:00.108048\nmyTimer: 00:00:00.212045 - end of step two\nmyTimer: 00:00:00.316084 - end of step three\n\nBut sometimes you don’t want to have prefabricated log entries or you need the elapsed time to write them in scripts to the server output. For this purpose the procedures time_current and time_end used in the code are also available as overloaded functions. With these you can do what you want:\n\nThis then leads to something like this server output:\n\nFor counting things or processes there are the same procedures and functions as for time measurements - only with the prefix count instead of time (we use the variant without label in the example):\n\nThis then results in a server output as follows:\n\nThe count_reset procedure used in the example also exists for timers and is called time_reset there. The respective *_end methods delete the entry from the list of timers/counters managed in the console package.\nAssert, format and other helpers\nThere are other auxiliary methods that make the developer’s life more pleasant. First of all, the assert procedure should be mentioned. Everyone should know this recurring pattern:\n\nIt gets especially ugly when you have to check multiple conditions. The whole thing can also be formulated as a one-liner:\n\nIf you want to enrich texts with dynamic information, then you are quickly in concatenation hell:\n\nHere the format function can help you:\n\nformat accepts up to 10 parameters and works according to the following rules:\n\nreplace all occurrences of %0 … %9 with the corresponding parameters p0 … p9\nreplace %n with new lines (line feed character)\nreplace all occurrences of %s in positional order with the corresponding parameters with sys.utl_lms.format_message - see also the Oracle docs\n\nI personally am very reluctant to type sys.dbms_output.put_line. Console does write to a log table with all the log methods, but actually the word console suggests that we can also write directly to the server output, right? For that we have the procedure print:\n\nThen there are the short forms of console.print(console.format(...)) and console.assert([boolean expression], console.format(...)):\n\nAlso often needed is a fast, cached clob concatenation - that’s where Console can help with clob_append &amp; clob_flush_cache.\nMore can be found in the API overview.\nDisplaying the package status of Console in a session\nIf you are interested in what is configured in the current session of Console, you can look at it with a pipelined table function or make it available in your application with a report:\n\nATTRIBUTEVALUE\nc_version1.0.0\nlocaltimestamp2021-10-03 13:58:00\nsysdate2021-10-03 11:58:00\ng_conf_check_sysdate2021-10-03 11:58:10\ng_conf_exit_sysdate2021-10-03 12:58:00\ng_conf_client_identifier{o,o} 11ECD3500002\ng_conf_level5\nlevel_name(g_conf_level)trace\ng_conf_check_interval10\ng_conf_enable_ascii_arttrue\ng_conf_call_stackfalse\ng_conf_user_envfalse\ng_conf_apex_envfalse\ng_conf_cgi_envfalse\ng_conf_console_envfalse\ng_counters.count1\ng_timers.count2\ng_saved_stack.count0\ng_prev_error_msg\n\nAPEX Error Handling Function\nFor APEX, Console comes with a so-called “Error Handling Function” which can enter errors within the APEX runtime environment into the log table. If you want to use this, you have to enter this function in your application in the “Application Builder” under “Edit Application Properties &gt; Error Handling &gt; Error Handling Function”: console.apex_error_handling.\n\n    \n    APEX error handling with ASCII art enabled\n\nThe Error Handling Function logs the technical error in the CONSOLE_LOGS table and writes a friendly message to the end user. It uses the APEX Text Message feature for the user-friendly messages in case of constraint violations, as described in this video by Anton and Neelesh from Insum, which in turn is based on an idea by Roel Hartman in this blog post. The APEX community rocks….\nAPEX Plug-in for capturing frontend errors\nFurthermore, there is an APEX Dynamic Action Plug-in, which enters JavaScript errors in the user’s browser via AJAX call into the log table. This way you also get to know if the frontend is not running smoothly for the users…\nYou have to make sure that Console is either installed in the parsing schema of the application or a synonym named CONSOLE has been created in the parsing schema which points to the package CONSOLE. Then you can install the plug-in in install/apex_plugin.sql and create a Dynamic Action for the whole application on page zero:\n\nEvent: Page Load\nAction: Oracle Instrumentation Console [Plug-in]\nNo further customization required (only a JavaScript file will be loaded)\n\nFor those interested in what the plug-in does: sources/apex_plugin_console.js. This is currently a minimal implementation and may be improved in the future.\nSources of inspiration\nI am not alone in the world and without the others not much goes in software development.
