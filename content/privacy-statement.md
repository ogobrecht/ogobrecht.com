I don't use any user tracking. This site is hosted on the infrastructure of strato.de and I have only access to the standard web server logs. The used commenting system is based on GitHub issues (no tracking, no ads).

For the german law I have to put the [imprint on a different page](/imprint/).

More [about me and this site](/about/).
