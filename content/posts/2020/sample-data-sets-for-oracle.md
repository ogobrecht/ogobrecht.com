Sometimes you need only some small tables and some rows of data to play around with, to test things out. I think most of you immediately would say EMP, DEPT...

Sure, but a bit more data would be nice. Ok, OE and HR schema...

Sure, but I have no SYS rights on the database in my current project to install the schemas, can I have it in my current dev schema?...

Sure, but then I have to fiddle a bit with the scripts to make it run in my dev schema, I need it fast, no time at all...

Mmhhh, sounds this familiar to you? Maybe I can help...

The sample data sets from Oracle were normally created for a dedicated schema. I changed that and omitted all the schema creation parts of the scripts. Instead, all objects from a data set get a prefix - an example: All objects from the customer orders schema (one of the newer data sets from Oracle) are prefixed with CO_. This allows me to use all data sets in parallel in a single schema and easily identify the data set the object belongs to.

All table scripts are created with identity columns and the simplest possible options for easy readability - no fancy constraint and index names. Constraints and indexes will be renamed with global helper scripts after the table creation. Only real indexes are coded - foreign key indexes are generated with a global helper script too.

For each data set, you have always the same three scripts to handle the installation/data refresh/uninstallation.

Hope this helps someone else...

Happy data modeling and testing<br>
