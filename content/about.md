## Me

<img src="/assets/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Photo Ottmar Gobrecht" title="Ottmar Gobrecht" class="left avatar"/>

Hi, I am Ottmar Gobrecht, a database developer living in Munich, Germany and this is my development blog - mainly about Oracle APEX and PL/SQL.

I am a little bit active in open source development - you can find my projects on [GitHub][gh] and of course [here on this site][pro].

## My Motivation

In the last years I was often happy to find solutions, informations and open source code provided by other people in their blogs and community sites. To write down my own experiences and share my code as open source projects is my way to give back what I received before.


## This Site

This site is built with [Hugo][hugo] (a static site generator) and my own template. The sources are [available at GitHub][ghp].
